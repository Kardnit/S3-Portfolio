## 1)Web Application

Our group project is a full-stack application that uses ReactJS (with TypeScript) for the front-end and ASP C# for the back-end. Our architecture is similar to the image below.

![Architecture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73908937/174277634-00826e11-fa44-4694-9848-1105564c87f1.png)

We decided to use React as it is one of the most influential and popular frameworks/libraries. React being so popular is advantageous as it is easy to find and learn 	new features. Also, Hummus is a single-page app due to its benefits, such as having a better user experience, performance, reusability, and optimization. Normally, React apps use JavaScript, and this causes difficulty for tracing errors, so we decided to use TypeScript. The back-end has simplified database interactions through ORM (relies on Entity Framework).

## 3)Agile Method

This semester I implemented the usage of SCRUM along with the use of the project board on JIRA (IP project) and Shortcut (GP project). I had multiple development cycles (sprints), with one cycle containing 2 to 3 weeks. Everyone in the group was given scrum roles at the beginning of the semester. We had a meeting with our client at the end of every sprint. We had daily sessions in the morning and occasional peer feedback to clear up any problems if needed.

## 5)Cultural Differences
Our group has five different cultures in total, so whenever I spoke with someone in the group, it was a new experience. We talked about the cultures, mentality, and motivation of our group members, so we had no issues with this topic, and it was perfect for me to learn about these different things.

## 6)Requirements and Design
We used Agile scrum, so according to the feedback we got, there were differences. 

For example:

## 7)Business processes

After talking with the POs, we verified that the essential aspect of the solution is to rebuild the conventional flow of ordering food at a restaurant with hardcover menus.

The diagram below shows this flow (between the waiter and the customer).

With the client's input, we developed the system so that some bottlenecks were entirely removed. Below is our flow of ordering food:

The new flow gives the customer much more freedom, eases orders, and frees waiters for other takes. The clients wished for waiters to still be a part of the process of greeting customers. No longer are orders required to be written down by a waiter and brought to the kitchen on paper. Placed orders are immediately redirected to the kitchen, where they are managed digitally.

The payments don't require an interaction with the waiters and are entirely online.

## 8) Professional

This semester I have done two types of research (JWT and Testing). I chose these topics to deliver a secure and error-free app to my client.

JWT Research: [JWT Research](https://github.com/Kardnit/Portfolio/tree/main/Research)

Testing Research: [Testing Research](https://github.com/Kardnit/Portfolio/tree/main/Research)

I used DOT framework research methods and implemented five under the Library, Field, and Showroom categories to make sure the research I had done was as accurate as possible, and these methods are as follows:

### 1. Available product analysis
### 2. Community research
### 3. Document analysis
### 4. Ethical check
### 5. Peer review

I thought I did well this semester, learning new technologies according to my requirements and implementing them in my project in the related part. I have learned more than seven technologies, so it was a huge workload in a limited amount of time. I want to improve in doing research, using agile methods, and software testing in the following semesters, and although I have implemented these subjects in my project, I believe these are the areas that have the room to develop the most.
