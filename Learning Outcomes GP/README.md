## 1)Web Application

Our group project is a full-stack application that uses ReactJS (with TypeScript) for the front-end and ASP C# for the back-end. Our architecture is similar to the image below.

![Architecture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73908937/174277634-00826e11-fa44-4694-9848-1105564c87f1.png)

We decided to use React as it is one of the most influential and popular frameworks/libraries. React being so popular is advantageous as it is easy to find and learn 	new features. Also, Hummus is a single-page app due to its benefits, such as having a better user experience, performance, reusability, and optimization. Normally, React apps use JavaScript, and this causes difficulty for tracing errors, so we decided to use TypeScript. The back-end has simplified database interactions through ORM (relies on Entity Framework).

## 3)Agile Method
Agile helps us manage the project and iteratively develop software. So it helps progress faster with more minor problems than the "big bang" launch. Agile delivers work in small sizes, but it is more steady progress.

Agile has 12 principles:
### 1.	Satisfy Customers Through Early & Continuous Delivery.
### 2.	Welcome Changing Requirements Even Late in the Project.
### 3.	Deliver Value Frequently.
### 4.	Break the Silos of Your Project.
### 5.	Build Projects Around Motivated Individuals.
### 6.	The Most Effective Way of Communication is Face-to-face.
### 7.	Working Software is the Primary Measure of Progress.
### 8.	Maintain a Sustainable Working Pace.
### 9.	Continuous Excellence Enhances Agility.
### 10.	Simplicity is Essential.
### 11.	Self-organizing Teams Generate Most Value.
### 12.	Regularly Reflect and Adjust Your Way of Work to Boost Effectiveness


SCRUM:
This semester I implemented the usage of SCRUM along with the use of the project board on JIRA (IP project) and Shortcut (GP project). I had multiple development cycles (sprints), with one cycle containing 2 to 3 weeks. Everyone in the group was given scrum roles at the beginning of the semester. We had a meeting with our client at the end of every sprint. We had daily sessions in the morning and occasional peer feedback to clear up any problems if needed.

![Jira](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73908937/168486773-d7e882a8-2fac-4977-83bd-f3f1b21bb43e.png)

![Shortcut](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73908937/168486784-36156e7c-abed-4134-af07-6c802d82839e.png)

KANBAN:
This semester I implemented the usage of KANBAN along with the use of the JIRA (IP project) project board. While I was using KANBAN, I had continuous development. As the Agile Coach, I was in contact with the PO, always trying to improve according to the feedback I got from the PO. After finishing tasks (as fast as possible because of the WIP limit) on the board, I reviewed the board and decided to pull something from the backlog. I had daily standups with the PO to ensure everything was according to our PO's requirements. I always delivered the finished parts and tried to improve the progress according to feedback.

![Kanban](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73908937/174633768-b56ece0a-548b-464f-af1b-888fcee12e6d.png)

|Difference|SCRUM|Kanban|
|---:|---|---|
|**Roles**| There are three roles in SCRUM. First is the SCRUM Master, who is the team's brain (helps cooperation between all roles and keeps the team focused on the work while encouraging them). Second is the Product Owner, which owns the Product backlog () and decides the release date and the content. The third is the Development Team| KANBAN doesn't necessarily require roles, but there are two roles. First is Service Delivery Manager (SDM), also known as Delivery Manager, Flow Manager, or Flow Master. SDM is responsible for ensuring a smooth workflow by managing meetings, checking how fast the board progresses, improving it, and making sure deliveries will be satisfactory to customers. The second is the Service Request Manager, who asks for new items to work on from the backlog and prioritizes them, and reduces the risk that individuals can cause by keeping track of the work that's being done|
|**Planning**| Each Sprint starts with Sprint Planning done by the Scrum Master, the Product Owners, and the Development Team. Together they choose high-priority stories from the Product Backlog that the Development Team can finish in the decided sprint time. The selected items are called Sprint Backlog | After checking the Product Backlog, chosen items are pulled |
|**Time Management**| SCRUM has cycles called Sprints mostly around 2-4 weeks | KANBAN is a continuous process |
|**Meetings**| SCRUM has Daily SCRUM that takes around 5-15 minutes (if possible, no more than 15). Attendees are Scrum Master, PO, and Dev Team. It aims to confirm that everyone is on the same page | KANBAN has Daily Standup that aims the same thing as a Daily SCRUM |
|**Delivery**| After a Sprint is over, first there is a Sprint Review (demo of the new features), second team observes how the sprint was and suggests ways to make the following sprints more efficient and effective, and lastly, completed stories are released, and incomplete stories return to the Backlog. | When an item is ready, it is released as soon as possible. A demonstration is made, and a review of the performance of the team is checked to see if there is a room for improvement  |

## 5)Cultural Differences
### What is culture? 
There are many answers to this question like “A system of understandings that describe how the members of a society customarily behave” or “A learned system of beliefs, feelings, and rules for living around which a group of people organizes their lives, a way of life of a particular society”. All of them are correct because it is a topic without a definitive answer, but to simply put it, it means the customary beliefs, social forms, and material traits of a racial, religious, or social group.

![Culture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73908937/174643338-8412e7d5-ebdf-436b-ac34-398135bd82bb.png)

### Cultural Dimensions? 
According to Hofstede, Cultural Dimensions are like:
|Dimension|Low Score|High Score|
|---:|---|---|
|**Power Distance**| Society de-emphasizes the differences between citizen’s power and wealth | Inequalities of power and wealth within society |
|**Individualism vs. Collectivism**| Collectivist nature with close ties between individuals | Individualism and individual rights are paramount |
|**Uncertainty Avoidance**| Tolerance for a variety of opinions, less concern about ambiguity and uncertainty | Low tolerance for uncertainty and ambiguity |
|**Masculinity vs. Femininity**| Value social relevance, quality of life, the welfare of others | Aggressive goal behavior, high gender differentiation, males dominate |
|**Long-term vs. Short-term Orientation**| Place less emphasis on hard work and perseverance | Embraces long-term devotion to traditional, forward-thinking values |

![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73908937/175781002-40a117fd-43dc-488f-a3e6-556c6533bb52.png)

![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73908937/175781011-d740e216-2ee6-4326-9e4e-129a1bb70369.png)

According to the charts, I come from a country with low Individualism, Masculinity, high Power Distance, and very high Uncertainty Avoidance. Except for low Masculinity (It should be high), I agree with all the information in the charts, and anyone who visits Turkey can observe this. So coming to the Netherlands is a different experience for me.

### Cultural Clusters? 
According to Richard Lewis, Cultural Clusters are like:
|Cluster|Explanation|
|---:|---|
|**Linear-Active**| Introvert, patient, quiet, minds own business, likes privacy, plans ahead methodically, does one thing at a time, works fixed hours, punctual, dominated by timetables, unemotional, accepts favors reluctantly, rarely interrupts, limited body language, brief on telephone, dislikes losing face, confronts with logic |
|**Multi-Active**| Extrovert, impatient, talkative, inquisitive, gregarious, plans grand outline only, does several things at a time, works any hours, is not punctual, timetable unpredictable, emotional, seeks favors, and frequently interrupts, unrestricted body, talks for hours, has ready excuses, confronts emotionally |
|**Reactive**| Introvert, patient, silent, respectful, good listener, look at general principles, reacts once, flexible hours, punctual, reacts to partner’s
and schedules timetable, quietly caring, protects the face of others, does not interrupt, subtle body language, summarizes well, must not lose face, avoids confrontation |

![Clusters](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73908937/175781425-511b000e-07d1-4b48-ac32-bbb4f085600b.png)

Even if it is not entirely accurate, I will put myself between Multi-Active and Linear-Active. I like to socialize and talk with new people. I am patient when listening to someone, but I expect the same when talking. I like to help people, and when I am lacking, I do not mind asking for help from someone who knows the topic ( I think it is vital to help and get help from others when we are so close to professional life). While I help someone or ask for help, I realized that the ACM Code of Ethics is essential to strengthening the bond with others (for example, 1.06: Be fair and avoid deception in all statements or 1.01: Accept full responsibility for their own work or 1.08: Be encouraged to volunteer professional skills to good causes and contribute to public education concerning the discipline).

### My experience with my group?
As a group with five different cultures, it was a little bit hard to understand what everyone had in their mind because even the way of talking and thinking was different from what I was used to back in Turkey. As time passed, I got used to how everyone expressed themselves and started understanding how everyone thinks (of course, not entirely, but I understood most of it). It was a little bit hard in the beginning because it can cause some misunderstandings, but in the end, it was excellent to have so much different cultures because each of us learned something new and got comfortable around each other (for example, we understood what was counted offensive in Turkey and acted according to it).

### Why are cultural differences significant for software engineers? 
Software engineers hold great power with the software they create (there can be millions of users or companies using that software). So as software developers, we need to consider the consequences of not thinking about this topic because even if it seems small to us, it can create significant confusion.

### What is ethics and why is it important in software development? 
According to Government of Canada:
“Derived from the Greek word “ethos”, which means “way of living”, ethics is a branch of philosophy that is concerned with human conduct, more specifically the behaviour of individuals in society. Ethics examines the rational justification for our moral judgments; it studies what is morally right or wrong, just or unjust”.

![Ethics](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73908937/174643719-8992d2ef-b71a-4d67-b73b-baab133a10a2.png)

In the last decades, companies like Facebook changed how we live, and it's not going in a good direction. If these companies start to exploit all the information they get about our lives, we will be very vulnerable. So with a power like that, all software owners/developers should consider the morality and ethics of the software they have for the safety of the person who uses it. Because this is a fundamental matter, in my IP and GP, we have taken consideration of this topic and developed our web applications according to the principles of ethical web development and other sources about this topic, like the example below:

![TICT](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73908937/174646145-fd93a90d-6874-443e-8f3c-c584436b42ad.png)

## 6)Requirements and Design
For this topic, we worked with Nour and searched for different available products across the internet (using the SWOT method). We created a design proposal for the PO with the online research and the field research (FoodHalen in Amsterdam).

We used Butlaro as our main inspiration while working on the design and created a simple design.

![Figma](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73908937/174627772-e134c6bb-12c6-4564-9b0d-bcecd20663b8.png)


We used Agile scrum, so according to the feedback we got, there were differences. 

For example:

Question:
![Question](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73908937/174280914-ac8ab026-7447-47c7-a41a-e65da27cc731.png)

Answer:
![Answer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73908937/174280959-7bee17ae-76cf-4697-a53a-5de616433426.png)

After finishing most of the basic design, I suggested using Yemeksepti (a Turkish food ordering website) in our design, too. Then we added the most user-friendly component to the website.

This component helps us to add/remove ingredients inside the meal
![Yemeksepeti](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73908937/174628837-6dec9f63-a635-4252-a952-496da9474c60.png)

After showing this to the PO, we also got approval to use this new feature.

## 7)Business processes

After talking with the POs, we verified that the essential aspect of the solution is to rebuild the conventional flow of ordering food at a restaurant with hardcover menus.

The diagram below shows this flow (between the waiter and the customer).
![BP1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73908937/174285161-4ca298b1-dacb-4d62-979e-d8a0a7ec11ef.jpg)

With the client's input, we developed the system so that some bottlenecks were entirely removed. Below is our flow of ordering food:

![BP2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73908937/174285837-9364a258-a29e-4a5d-9a89-3c36920e5aa7.jpg)

The new flow gives the customer much more freedom, eases orders, and frees waiters for other takes. The clients wished for waiters to still be a part of the process of greeting customers. No longer are orders required to be written down by a waiter and brought to the kitchen on paper. Placed orders are immediately redirected to the kitchen, where they are managed digitally.

![BP3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73908937/174286330-1a93ad8e-7eb6-4716-b1e3-8a8d6732fe20.jpg)

The payments don't require an interaction with the waiters and are entirely online.

## 8) Professional

This semester I have done two types of research (JWT and Testing). I chose these topics to deliver a secure and error-free app to my client.

JWT Research: [JWT Research](https://github.com/Kardnit/Portfolio/tree/main/Research)

Testing Research: [Testing Research](https://github.com/Kardnit/Portfolio/tree/main/Research)

I used DOT framework research methods and implemented five under the Library, Field, and Showroom categories to make sure the research I had done was as accurate as possible, and these methods are as follows:

### 1. Available product analysis
### 2. Community research
### 3. Document analysis
### 4. Ethical check
### 5. Peer review

I thought I did well this semester, learning new technologies according to my requirements and implementing them in my project in the related part. I have learned more than seven technologies, so it was a huge workload in a limited amount of time. I want to improve in doing research, using agile methods, and software testing in the following semesters, and although I have implemented these subjects in my project, I believe these are the areas that have the room to develop the most.
