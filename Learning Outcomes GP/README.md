In this semester I Implemented the usage of SCRUM along with the usage of the project board on JIRA and Shortcut. I had multiple cycles of development (sprints) with 1 cycle containing 2-3 weeks. In my group we had daily meetings in the morning and also did peer-feedback occasionally, to clear up any problems if needed.
